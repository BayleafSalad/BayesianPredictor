/edit:  For some reason you can't view the spreadsheet on here, so just click "view raw" to download.  Or you can hit download.

Imagine being able to slowly teach a spreadsheet how to make predictions based on pattern recognition?  
Well now you can!  
My little cat and mouse predictor is a project that uses a cat's "door choices" to help predict where it will end up in the future.
The cat will move through a series of doors (A(1-5), B(1-5) C(1-5).  And its usual door patterns and final destinations will be reflected in the history. (You'll have to add that yourself, I'm afraid).
Simply add door choices for the "actively observed data" (A(1-5), B(1-5) C(1-5)) and the spreadsheet will consult its training history, and make a prediction on the most likely 
destination using a naive baysian algorithm.
It's a little bit like how AI works anyway.  Training data is used to predict the next destination.  Pretty neat.
This was just for fun/educational purposes. I hope you like it!

Not responsible if some moron somehow uses this to harm someone else.  Idk. Don't hit anyone over the head with your laptop while using this program.
